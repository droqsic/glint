**Glint** is a lightweight, cross-platform Go library for detecting and enabling terminal color support. It combines performance, accuracy, and simplicity ‚Äî with benchmarks showing it's up to **1000x faster** than alternatives.

## Features

- ‚ö° **High Performance**: Advanced caching makes repeated checks nearly instantaneous
- üåê **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, BSD, and more
- üß† **Zero Allocations**: Efficient design ensures no heap allocations
- üîí **Thread-Safe**: Safe for concurrent use from multiple goroutines
- üßº **Simple API**: Easy to use and integrate
- üì¶ **Minimal Dependencies**: Only depends on the Go standard library, `x/sys`, and `probe`

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/droqsic/glint
```

## Quick Start

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/droqsic/glint"
)

func main() {
    if glint.IsColorSupported() {
        fmt.Println("Terminal supports colors")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Terminal does not support colors")
    }

    fmt.Printf("Color support level: %s\n", glint.IsColorSupportedLevel())

    // Force-enable color support (use cautiously)
    glint.ForceColorSupport()
}
```

## How It Works

Glint determines terminal color support through:

- üßæ **Environment Variables**: Inspects `TERM`, `COLORTERM`, `NO_COLOR`
- üß™ **Terminal Detection**: Uses the `probe` library to check if output is a terminal
- ü™ü **Windows Support**: Enables virtual terminal sequences when necessary
- üåà **Color Levels**: Distinguishes between None, 16, 256, and True Color

All results are cached to ensure ultra-fast subsequent checks.

## Performance

Glint is engineered for speed. Here's what benchmarks reveal:

```
BenchmarkIsColorSupported-12                1000000000	         0.25 ns/op
BenchmarkIsColorSupportedLevel-12           1000000000	         0.89 ns/op
BenchmarkForceColorSupport-12               42567984	        30.15 ns/op
```

- üîÅ **Cached Checks**: Almost all operations complete in under 1 ns
- ü™Ñ **Zero Allocations**: No memory allocations for any operation
- üíØ **High Throughput**: Ideal for performance-critical CLI tools

## Color Support Levels

Glint can detect four levels of color support:

| Level       | Colors          | Example Terminals                               |
| ----------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `LevelNone` | 0               | Non-interactive shells, logs                    |
| `Level16`   | 16 ANSI colors  | `xterm`, `vt100`, `screen`                      |
| `Level256`  | 256 colors      | `xterm-256color`, `screen-256color`             |
| `LevelTrue` | 16M true colors | Terminals with `COLORTERM=truecolor` or `24bit` |

## Thread Safety

Glint is built with concurrency in mind. It uses synchronization mechanisms such as `sync.Once` and `sync.Map` to manage its internal cache, allowing multiple goroutines to access color support checks safely and efficiently. The design is optimized for read-heavy workloads, ensuring high throughput and low latency even under concurrent access. This makes Glint well-suited for use in modern, parallelized Go applications.
