</div>

A lightweight, cross-platform Go library to detect and enable terminal color support. Glint offers superior performance with a sophisticated caching mechanism, making it up to 1000x faster than alternatives.

## Features

- **High Performance**: Optimized caching mechanism makes repeated checks nearly instantaneous
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on all major platforms including Windows, macOS, Linux, BSD, and more
- **Zero Allocations**: Makes no memory allocations for any operations
- **Thread-Safe**: Designed for concurrent access from multiple goroutines
- **Simple API**: Clean, intuitive interface that's easy to integrate
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only depends on standard library, x/sys, and probe

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/droqsic/glint
```

## Usage

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"

    "github.com/droqsic/glint"
)

func main() {
    // Check if terminal supports colors
    if glint.IsColorSupported() {
        fmt.Println("Terminal supports colors")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Terminal does not support colors")
    }

    // Get a human-readable description of the color support level
    colorLevel := glint.IsColorSupportedLevel()
    fmt.Printf("Color support level: %s\n", colorLevel)

    // Force color support
    fmt.Println("Before forcing:", glint.IsColorSupported())
    glint.ForceColorSupport()
    fmt.Println("After forcing:", glint.IsColorSupported())
}
```

## How It Works

Glint uses multiple detection mechanisms to determine color support:

- **Environment Variables**: Checks `TERM`, `COLORTERM`, and `NO_COLOR`
- **Terminal Detection**: Uses `probe` to detect if output is connected to a terminal
- **Windows Support**: Enables virtual terminal processing on Windows when needed
- **Color Levels**: Detects different levels of color support (none, 16 colors, 256 colors, true color)

Results are cached for performance, making repeated checks extremely fast.

## Performance

Color support detection can be an expensive operation. Glint implements an efficient caching mechanism that makes subsequent checks nearly instantaneous.

Key observations:

- Glint's cached color support detection is **1000x faster** than uncached alternatives
- Glint makes **zero memory allocations** for all operations
- All operations are extremely fast, with most taking less than 1 nanosecond

## Color Support Levels

Glint detects four levels of color support:

| Level       | Description                                  | Example Terminals                                     |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `LevelNone` | No color support (0 colors)                  | Plain text terminals, redirected output               |
| `Level16`   | Basic ANSI color support (16 colors)         | xterm, screen, vt100                                  |
| `Level256`  | Extended color support (256 colors)          | xterm-256color, screen-256color                       |
| `LevelTrue` | 24-bit RGB color support (16,777,216 colors) | Terminals with COLORTERM=truecolor or COLORTERM=24bit |

## Thread Safety

Glint is designed with concurrency in mind. The library implements a synchronization mechanism using sync.Once and sync.Map to protect its internal cache, allowing for high-throughput concurrent access patterns common in modern Go applications.

The caching layer is optimized for read-heavy workloads typical of color support detection scenarios, making it ideal for high-performance applications.
